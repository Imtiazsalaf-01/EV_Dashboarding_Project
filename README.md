# 🚗 Electric Vehicle Dashboard – India

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) sales data in India and presents key insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
The objective is to understand EV adoption trends, penetration rates, manufacturer performance, and sales growth across different states and vehicle categories.

The project combines **Python (for basic data analysis)** and **Power BI (for dashboarding and visualization)**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze state-wise and maker-wise EV sales in India  
- Measure EV penetration compared to total vehicle sales  
- Identify top EV manufacturers  
- Understand vehicle category distribution (2-Wheelers vs 4-Wheelers)  
- Visualize EV sales trends over time  
- Build an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas)
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV Datasets**
- **DAX (for calculated measures in Power BI)**

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The project uses the following datasets:

- `electric_vehicle_sales_by_state.csv`  
  - Date  
  - State  
  - Vehicle Category  
  - Electric Vehicles Sold  
  - Total Vehicles Sold  

- `electric_vehicle_sales_by_makers.csv`  
  - Date  
  - Manufacturer  
  - Vehicle Category  
  - Electric Vehicles Sold  

- `dim_date.csv` (date dimension file)

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes:

### 🔹 KPI Cards
- Total EV Sold  
- Total Vehicle Sold  
- EV Penetration Rate (%)  
- EV Growth (%)  

### 🔹 Visualizations
- EV Sales & Penetration Rate by State (Column + Line Chart)  
- Top 5 EV Manufacturers (Bar Chart)  
- EV Sales by Vehicle Category (Donut Chart)  
- EV Sales Trend Over Time (Line Chart)  

### 🔹 Interactivity
- Slicers for:
  - State  
  - Year  
  - Vehicle Category

## 🐍 Python Analysis
The Python notebook (`EV_Data_Analysis.ipynb`) performs:
- Data loading using Pandas  
- Basic data preview and exploration  
- High-level observations to support dashboard insights  

The notebook is intentionally kept simple, as the primary focus of the project is dashboarding.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu lead in EV adoption  
- Two-wheelers dominate EV sales across most states  
- EV penetration in India is still below 5%, indicating strong growth potential  
- EV sales show a consistent upward trend over recent years  

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end dashboarding workflow, from data understanding and basic Python analysis to building an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
It is suitable for **data analytics portfolios, academic submissions, and entry-level analytics roles**.
